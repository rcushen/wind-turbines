    "My suggestion for Engine is to build a 'digital twin' of the wind turbine. This is a digital representation of the wind turbine, which we can use to simulate the behaviour of the wind turbine under a variety of conditions. We can then use this model to predict the future behaviour of the wind turbine, given a weather forecast, as well as identify when certain attributes of the wind turbine are not behaving as expected.\n",

    "\n",
    "To start with, let us construct a model of the active power output, as a function of the weather. We know that there is a direct causual relationship between these two observables, so we should be able to attain strong model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can denote this simple model as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = f(W) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P \\in \\mathcal{P} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is the active power output, $W \\in \\mathcal{W} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^5$ is a vector of weather variables, composed of wind speed, wind direction (away from the nacelle), temperature, air pressure and humidity, and $f: \\mathcal{W} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a representation of the wind turbine system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will immediately run into a problem here! The wind turbine system does not run in a vacuum – it is also attached to the power grid, meaning that the observed real power generated will also be a funtion of grid demand. But we do not have access to grid demand data...\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, however, use the reactive power output as a proxy (i.e. instrumental variable) for the grid demand, since:\n",
    "* Reactive power is correlated with grid demand (I think...)\n",
    "* Reactive power is not nominally correlated with the weather, and a priori, not correlated with active power.\n",
    "Our updated model is therefore\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = f(W, Q) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Q \\in \\mathcal{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ is the reactive power output.\n",
