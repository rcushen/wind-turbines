    "### Wind Turbines: A Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind turbines convert kinetic wind energy into electrical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Wind spins the rotor, which is connected to a gearbox, which is connected to a generator. Low speed, high torque goes to high speed, low torque.\n",
    "* It's all just basic physics: $P = \\tau \\omega$. In particular, power increases with the cube of wind speed (torque increases in the square). Air density (i.e. temperature and pressure) also play a role.\n",
    "* But the rotors are not spun arbitrarily fast! Instead, they typically operate around fixed bands, so power output is mostly a function of torque.\n",
    "* The rotor's control systems will ensure that the rotor is spun at the optimal speed, given the wind speed.\n",
    "* The input to the generator is therefore a given rotor speed and torque. The control systems of the generator will then manage the excitation level of the generator, to ensure that the maximum amount of power is being generated whilst also maintaining the stability of the grid. These outputs are captured by the active power and reactive power variables.\n"

    "* Our wind turbines are the *Senvion MM82* model\n",
    "* This model starts working at a wind speed of 3.5 m/s and has a cut-out speed of 25 m/s.\n",
    "* It has a rated wind speed of 14.5 m/s and a rated power of 2,050kW. This is equivalent to about one-four-hundredth of the power of a nuclear reactor.\n",
    "* It also has a maximum rotor speed of 17 rpm, and a tipspeed of 73 m/s (which is 262km/h)"
